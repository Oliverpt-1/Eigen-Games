# GateKeeper

GateKeeper is a decentralized solution designed to protect users against sandwich attacks in Web3 and Crypto transactions. It leverages Uniswap V4 and EigenLayer AVS through Othentic to provide secure and validated transactions.

## Architecture Overview

GateKeeper implements a secure transaction flow:
1. Transaction request from front-end
2. AVS-based validation with zero-knowledge proofs
3. Secure execution on Uniswap V4
