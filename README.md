## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
# No installation required for the web interface - UniGuard is a web-based tool
# For local development, clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Oliverpt-1/Eigen-Games.git
```

### Quick Start
1. Navigate to the UniGuard web interface
2. Paste your Uniswap V4 hook contract code
3. Select either "Generate Tests" or "Run Security Audit"
4. Review the results and implement suggested improvements

## Running the System

If you want to run UniGuard locally or deploy your own instance, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+ and npm
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Othentic AVS credentials (for consensus validation)
- Foundry (for smart contract testing)

### Environment Setup
.env files in both bug_huntoor and createTestAgent.  Fill out accordingly in order to run this locally.


```

NOTE ON AVS:
1. To run the AVS locally, you will need to navigate to the othentic-avs docs and spin up a local instance (we didn't want to put our private key in the repo lol)
2. Note that running docker compose up --build will suffice once the AVS is completed
# Backend Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

```

### Running the Frontend

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd new_front_end

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# The UI will be available at http://localhost:5173
```

### Running the Backend

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd deployer_and_tester

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# The API will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

### Running the AI Agents

UniGuard uses two separate AI agents: one for test generation and another for security auditing.

#### Test Generation Agent

```bash
# Navigate to the agents directory
cd createTestAgent 

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the test generation agent
npm start

# The agent will be available at http://localhost:3001
```

#### Security Audit Agent

The security audit agent will run through the AVS, so you have to write curl queries to the AVS to get the results. 


### Verifying Installation

To verify that all components are running correctly:

```bash
# Check frontend
curl http://localhost:5173

# Check backend
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check test generation agent
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Check security audit agent
curl http://localhost:3002/health
```

All endpoints should return a 200 OK response if the services are running properly.

## Features

### AI-Powered Test Generation
UniGuard leverages advanced LLM models to analyze your Uniswap V4 hook contracts and generate comprehensive test suites. These tests cover:

- Basic functionality verification
- Edge case handling
- Reentrancy protection
- Gas optimization
- Integration with Uniswap V4 core

### Security Auditing
Our AI-driven security scanner examines your code for:

- Common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, front-running, etc.)
- Uniswap V4-specific security issues
- Gas inefficiencies
- Logic errors
- Compliance with best practices

### Decentralized Validation
UniGuard integrates with the Othentic stack to provide:

- Decentralized verification of security assessments
- Consensus-based validation through an Active Verification Service (AVS)
- Tamper-proof audit records
- Transparent security scoring

## Test Generation

### How It Works
1. **Code Analysis**: Our AI agent analyzes your hook contract to understand its functionality
2. **Test Case Generation**: Based on the analysis, the system generates Forge-compatible test cases
3. **Test Execution**: Tests are run in a sandboxed environment
4. **Result Reporting**: Detailed test results are presented in an easy-to-understand format

### Example Test Output
```
[PASS] testBasicSwapWithHook() (Gas: 123,456)
[PASS] testLiquidityAddition() (Gas: 78,901)
[FAIL] testReentrancyProtection() - Expected revert not received
```

### Interpreting Results
- **Passing Tests**: Functionality working as expected
- **Failing Tests**: Potential issues that need addressing
- **Gas Metrics**: Performance indicators for each operation

## Security Auditing

### Vulnerability Detection
UniGuard scans for multiple categories of vulnerabilities:

1. **Critical**
   - Reentrancy vulnerabilities
   - Unauthorized access to pool funds
   - Logic errors allowing manipulation

2. **High**
   - Front-running opportunities
   - Improper access control
   - Unsafe external calls

3. **Medium**
   - Gas inefficiencies
   - Suboptimal hook implementations
   - Missing validation checks

4. **Low**
   - Code style issues
   - Documentation gaps
   - Minor optimization opportunities

### Audit Report Structure
Each audit generates a comprehensive report containing:

- Executive summary
- Vulnerability breakdown by severity
- Detailed explanations with code references
- Recommended fixes
- Gas optimization suggestions

## AVS Consensus

### Othentic Integration
UniGuard leverages the Othentic stack's Active Verification Service (AVS) to:

1. Distribute security assessments across multiple verification nodes
2. Reach consensus on the security status of submitted contracts
3. Provide tamper-proof verification of audit results
4. Create an immutable record of security assessments

### Consensus Mechanism
The AVS employs a multi-stage verification process:

1. **Initial Assessment**: AI-generated security report
2. **Node Verification**: Multiple nodes independently verify findings
3. **Consensus Building**: Nodes reach agreement on security status
4. **Final Determination**: Aggregated results presented to the user

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
UniGuard consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Web Interface**: User-facing dashboard for code submission and result viewing
2. **AI Engine**: Hyperbolic LLM models for test generation and security analysis
3. **Test Runner**: Foundry-based execution environment for contract testing
4. **Security Scanner**: Specialized code analysis tools for vulnerability detection
5. **Othentic AVS**: Decentralized network for consensus-based validation
6. **Result Aggregator**: System for compiling and presenting findings

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is UniGuard free to use?**  
A: UniGuard offers both free and premium tiers. Basic testing and security scanning are available at no cost, while advanced features require a subscription.

**Q: How accurate is the AI-powered security analysis?**  
A: Our system achieves approximately 85-90% accuracy in detecting common vulnerabilities. The AVS consensus mechanism helps validate findings and reduce false positives.

**Q: Can UniGuard test hooks for protocols other than Uniswap V4?**  
A: Currently, UniGuard specializes in Uniswap V4 hooks, but support for additional protocols is planned for future releases.

**Q: How does the AVS consensus mechanism work?**  
A: Security assessments are distributed to multiple verification nodes in the Othentic network. Each node independently evaluates the findings, and a consensus is reached based on the collective determination.

**Q: Can I integrate UniGuard into my development workflow?**  
A: Yes, UniGuard offers API endpoints that can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and security scanning.
