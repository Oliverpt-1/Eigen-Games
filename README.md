# BugHuntoor: The Easiest Platform for Uniswap V4 Hook Safety

BugHuntoor is a decentralized security platform designed specifically for Uniswap V4 hook developers, providing automated security analysis, vulnerability detection, and malicious code identification through a consensus-based validation network powered by EigenLayer's AVS framework.

## Overview 

Uniswap V4 hooks are powerful but introduce new security challenges. BugHuntoor provides a comprehensive security solution that:

1. Automatically analyzes hook code for vulnerabilities and malicious patterns
2. Uses advanced LLMs to detect potential security issues before deployment
3. Leverages decentralized validators to reach consensus on security findings
4. Provides clear, actionable security reports for developers

## Key Features

### For Developers

- **One-Click Security Analysis**: Upload your hook code and receive comprehensive security analysis in minutes
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identify common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, access control issues, and MEV vulnerabilities
- **Malicious Pattern Recognition**: Detect intentionally harmful code patterns that could compromise user funds
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Receive specific suggestions to fix identified issues
- **Pre-Deployment Verification**: Verify your hook's safety before deploying to mainnet

### Technical Capabilities

1. **Advanced LLM Analysis**
   - Multi-model security analysis using state-of-the-art LLMs
   - Specialized prompts for Uniswap V4 hook security
   - Pattern recognition based on known vulnerabilities
   - Continuous learning from new attack vectors

2. **Decentralized Validation**
   - Consensus-based security verification
   - EigenLayer AVS integration for trustless operation
   - Stake-weighted validator network
   - Transparent security attestations

3. **Comprehensive Security Checks**
   - Reentrancy vulnerabilities
   - Integer overflow/underflow
   - Unchecked external calls
   - Access control issues
   - Front-running vulnerabilities
   - Gas optimization issues
   - Logic errors
   - Sandwich attack vulnerabilities
   - MEV vulnerabilities

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
